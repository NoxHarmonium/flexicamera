===========

A flexible camera system for Unity3D

Currently under development, this camera plugin for Unity3D aims to be multipurpose camera that makes it easy to combine several different camera influences gracefully to enable things like tweening of the camera. At the moment it isn't actually very flexible as I'm developing it with a work project in mind, but I aim to expand the functionality in my free time.

Currently Implimented Controllers
---------------------------------
- Flyover (pan)
- Zoom
- Orbit
- Pan Into Bounds
- Zoom Into Bounds

Currently Implimented Input Adapters
------------------------------------
- FingerGestures v3

Usage
-----
If you're developing on OSX, I recommend checking out the repository into a seperate folder and adding a symlink in your Unity project's plugins folder to the relivant folder in the repository. Otherwise you can just copy the 'Assets/Plugins/FlexiCamera' folder into your plugins directory.
